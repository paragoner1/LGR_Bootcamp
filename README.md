# My Rust Journey
Hey! I’m Paragoner, a Rust developer in training, building skills for Solana DeFi auditing. This repo is my work from the Let’s Get Rusty Bootcamp—core Rust concepts I’ve mastered—plus my first real project: a Solana Transaction Fee Tracker (coming soon!).

## Highlights
- **Solana Fee Tracker** (in progress): A tool to calculate Solana wallet fees—my step into real-world Rust.
- **Rust Skills**: See folders like `ownership/`, `enums/`, `structs/`—I’ve got the fundamentals down.

## Why This Matters
I’m grinding to become a Solana smart contract auditor. These projects show my progress—check my code and watch me grow!
